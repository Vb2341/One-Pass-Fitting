def detect_peaks(data, hmin, fmin, pmax):
    """
    Detect sources in an astronomical image.

    This function performs source detection on a 2D image by finding local
    maxima in an image that within a range of brightness.  Specifically, it
    first finds local maxima in `data` that are at least `hmin` pixels separated
    from any higher pixel value via using a maximum filter on `data`, with a
    circular kernel of radius `hmin`.  For each of the detected maxima, it then
    calculates the sum of the  brightest 2x2 pixel box  containing the given
    maximum (for any pixel, there are 4 2x2 blocks that contain it).  If the sum
    is less than `fmin` the source is rejected.  It then throws out any source
    with a brightest pixel value greater than `pmax`.  After all these steps,
    the x and y pixel indices of the remaining sources are returned in two
    arrays.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    data : ndarray
        A 2D array of image data to perform source detection on.
    hmin : int
        Size of the circular kernel used for maximum filtering, which controls the
        desired distance between local maxima.
    fmin : float
        The minimum flux required for a source to be considered a valid detection.
    pmax : float
        The maximum pixel value allowed for a source to be considered valid.

    Returns:
    --------
    xi : ndarray
        An array containing the integer x-coordinates of the detected sources.
    yi : ndarray
        An array containing the integer y-coordinates of the detected sources.

    Example
    -------
    >>> data = 2D array containing image data
    >>> hmin = 5  # Circular kernel size for maximum filtering
    >>> fmin = 1000.0  # Minimum flux for a valid source
    >>> pmax = 50000.0  # Maximum pixel value for a valid source
    >>> xi, yi = detect_sources(data, hmin, fmin, pmax)
    >>>  # `xi` and `yi` contain the coordinates of the detected sources.

    Notes
    -----
    - This function combines various techniques, including maximum filtering, convolution,
      and peak finding, to locate sources in the input image.
    - Detected sources must meet the specified criteria of minimum flux (`fmin`) and
      maximum pixel value (`pmax`) to be considered valid detections.
